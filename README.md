# TargetSeeker_PathFinder
The project simply covers implementation of the A-Star (A*) search algorithm using in C# using MS Visual Studio Windows Forms.
In this project, different types of search approaches have been considered such as Breadth First Search, Greedy Search and A-Star (A*) search but one strategy was selected that best yields the goal in a short period of time. Therefore an informed search approach was selected that being A* after weighing its advantages against blind search strategies and other informed search strategies. A* search strategy is selected based on its properties such as its completeness, its optimality, its strategy of using the cost/g(n) and heuristic that being represented as h(n) which is the estimated cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal through the formula f(n) = g(n) + h(n) in which f(n) is the estimated cost of path through n to the goal.
